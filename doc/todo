TO-DO
=====

The semicolons are unfortunate! Try to eliminate them to make case blocks look nicer.
  Periods?
  Curly braces?

Think about nicer function definition syntax, too.

Bring back a nicer syntax for defining modules

Make it possible to define an "otherwise" case in a function-case without having to
write one underscore for each argument.

Turn on -Wall and -Werror!

Add simpler syntax for the common cases of algebraic data types

Add syntax for decision tables

Add a new form of type constraints that limit effects

Think about how to solve the problem of the fact that many sigs could be
expressed in many equivalent ways, and whichever of the ways we don't choose
would have provided all kinds of utility functions that will end up defined
outside the sig. But it seems unnatural to force a particular choice of
definining functions across all implementations of that sig.

  This could be a great use of something like datalog. Let the author of the sig
  give rules describing whether or not any particular subset of the functions makes
  a valid implementation.

Think about how to make sigs and modules as easy to use as typeclasses in the common
case.

Improve error messages in the parser

Use a proper type for keywords rather than storing them in strings, since it can lead
to errors when a keyword is referenced in the parser that the lexer doesn't produce.
