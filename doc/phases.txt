Phases of Compilation
=====================

 1. Lexical analysis
 2. Syntactic analysis
 3. Scope linker (link local scopes to their parents)
 
 4. Name resolution (add a pointer from each ref to its binding) (also make sure refs don't violate sigs)
 5. Module application (generate records for all module applications and update all module expressions to be refs)
 6. Data type-checking (make sure all data declarations are valid)
 7. Value type-checking (make sure all value declarations have a correct type signature; infer missing ones)
 8. Module sig-checking (make sure all modules obey their declared sigs)
 9. Simplification
10. Optimization
11. Code generation
