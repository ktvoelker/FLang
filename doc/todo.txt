TO-DO
=====

Rationalize types as we did for modules and sigs

  Get rid of the quantifier list and just use Fn to abstract over types
  
  Get rid of TyRecord and just use Record
  
    This will require defining TyDecl

Enable other declaration forms to appear inside local bindings when it makes sense

Pattern problem: there's no syntactic distinction between a nullary constructor pattern
  and a variable-binding pattern

Change OpChain to use an Expr[P] for each operator

  That way, special operators like TyFn can be represented more precisely

Use packrat parsers to improve performance

Improve error messages in the parser
