Write a name resolver

  Think about what exactly this will do. Things we might want:
  1. Links from child nodes to their parents. (What would the types be?)
  2. Refs can then point directly to their nodes. (You can get the context by going up.)

Write a type-checker

Improve error messages in the parser

Add syntax for decision tables

Add a new form of type constraints that limit effects

Use packrat parsers
