TO-DO
=====

Rationalize types as we did for modules and sigs

  Get rid of the quantifier list and just use Fn to abstract over types

Enable other declaration forms to appear inside local bindings when it makes sense

Convert escape characters into the real thing in the lexer

  Change the payload type of TChar to Char

Pattern problem: there's no syntactic distinction between a nullary constructor pattern
  and a variable-binding pattern

Change OpChain to use an Expr[P] for each operator

  That way, special operators like TyFn can be represented more precisely
